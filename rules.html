          </header>
          <p>We have four simple rules to ensure the smooth functioning of the group. Please follow these.</br></p>
          <p>1. <b>No Off Topic Messages</b> - SDS is for programmers, so we expect the messages here to be programming related. No memes, gifs etc.</p>
          <p>2. <b>No Spamming</b> - You can promote your app/website/event as long as you don't spam us with it. Your event should be programming related. Limit it to one message describing what you're promoting, relevant link(s) and one image. You will have to describe anything you're promoting - you can not just leave a link or image.</p>
          <p>3. <b>No Swearing</b> - Be respectful of other members here and refrain from using foul language. Using foul language will result in an <b>instant three day ban.</b></p>
          <p>4. <b>No Low Quality Messages</b> - Please refrain from sending messages that do not contribute to the discussion. ( "Good morning", just emojis etc). Move personal conversations to your personal chats.</p>
          <p>Violation of any of these rules will result in a warning. Repeat offenders will get banned.</p>
