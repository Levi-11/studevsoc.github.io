This post is intended to test how the code styling is working.

To put a code snippet in your blog post add ``` before the first line and after the last line of your code snippet.

The site uses markdown to format blog posts. It is a very simple formatting language. If you are not familiar with it, you can get familiar with it in five minutes in this link. If you'd rather write in html, you can do that too. Additionally, you could just send us your plaintext file along with any images in your post and we can work it out from our end. I typed this paragraph out to test if I can remove the code snippet from the post preview.

```

public class HangmanLogic {

    private String word;
    private String guessedLetters;
    private int numberOfFaults;
    private String formedWord = "";

    public HangmanLogic(String word) {
        this.word = word.toUpperCase();
        this.guessedLetters = "";
        this.numberOfFaults = 0;
    }

    public int numberOfFaults() {
        return this.numberOfFaults;
    }

    public String guessedLetters() {
        return this.guessedLetters;
    }

    public int losingFaultAmount() {
        return 12;
    }

    public void guessLetter(String letter) {
    	if(guessedLetters.contains(letter));
    	else if(word.contains(letter) == false) numberOfFaults++;
    	if(guessedLetters.contains(letter) == false) guessedLetters += letter;
    	if(word.contains(letter)) formedWord += letter;

		
    }

    public String hiddenWord() {
		String hidWord = "";

		for(int i=0;i<word.length();i++){
    		hidWord += "_";
		}

		for(int i=0;i<formedWord.length();i++) {
			String character = "" + formedWord.charAt(i);
			if (word.contains(character)){
				word.indexOf(character);
			};
		}
		return hidWord;
        
    }
}

```
